Description: A deterministic approach to estimate an individual's date of
    birth by intersecting possible ranges derived from a collection of known
    ages and corresponding dates. This package provides a robust method to
    narrow down possible dates of birth, especially useful in scenarios where
    only fragmented age data is available over time.
